# React Application Setup

Now, we’re going to get started with a React implementation of our contact list app. We’ll begin by configuring index.html and installing the React libraries.

React is quite different from the other frameworks we’re looking at—Angular, Ember and Backbone are complete MVC solutions, but React is only a view layer. So we’ll be plugging in other libraries to complete the model and controller functionality.
