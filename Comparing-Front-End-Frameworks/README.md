There are so many amazing front-end JavaScript frameworks out there, and sometimes it can be hard to figure out which one to use! Each framework has its adherents who will tell you how great it is, but how can we choose between them? To make an informed choice, we need to experiment with each framework: to get a feel for how it works and to begin to decide whether it is best suited to our own project needs or style of programming.

During the course, we're going to build an address book application with four different front-end frameworks: **Backbone**, **Angular**, **React** and **Ember**. We'll get a feeling for how they all work, and how they stack up against one another.

## React JS - Facebook
- Only View component only
- Not a MVC, donc a besoin d'un module pour le model et Router


## Ember
- Permet facilement de s'adapter a l'API du backend si pas conforme au standard d'Ember
- Bien connect√© entre le model et la Router
